# Path Planning Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
This project implements a path planner to drive a car in highway traffic in the Udacity simulator.
   

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

## Simulator interface

The simulator provides the program with information about the car and surrounding vehicles, and expects a list of points that will determine the path to follow. 

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program:

- The car's position, both in map coordinates and frenet coordinates

- The car's yaw angle in the map

- The car's speed in MPH

- Unprocessed section of the previous path (generated by the program), both in map and frenet coordinates. 


- "Sensor_fusion" data: information about each other car in the same side of the road, including a unique id, car position and speed.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. 

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Behaviour and Path planning
A very simple approach to behaviour planning was used:

- If there are no cars ahead of us, we'll keep the lane, at about 50mph.
- If there's a car in front of us that will block the way:
	-	We first consider moving to the left.
	-  If moving to the left is not possible (because we are in the leftmost lane, or there's a car there), we try moving to the right.
	-  If moving to either side is not possible, we slow down. 

The high level code for this behaviour can be seen from line 390 of `main.cpp`, and the helper functions to check for cars from line 256 in the same file.

These actions only change the desired speed or the desired lane for the car. 

With that information, the unprocessed points from the previously generated path will be kept, adding additional points generated as follows:
 
 - A spline is generated using the [spline function](http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) by Tino Kluge and five points:
 	- 	Two points from the previous path are used to ensure the new path neatly follows it.
 	-  Three points ahead of the car, in the desired lane. If it is different from the starting lane, the spline will make it a smooth lane change.
 -  As many points as necessary are sampled from the spline to complete the path to be sent to the simulator.
